### During the Exam

#### Initial Setup (First 10 minutes)
1. **Read all tasks quickly** - get overview of what's needed
2. **Check system hostnames** - understand the environment
3. **Test connectivity** - ensure SSH works between systems
4. **Note dependencies** - identify tasks that depend on others
5. **Plan your sequence** - tackle easier tasks first for confidence

#### Task Execution Strategy
1. **Time boxing**: Allocate maximum time per task (don't get stuck)
2. **Verify immediately**: Test each task completion before moving on
3. **Skip and return**: If stuck, mark task and continue
4. **Document issues**: Quick notes on partial completions
5. **Save regularly**: Some tasks auto-save, others need manual saves

### Category 2: Storage Management (25-30% of exam)
**Typical Tasks**:
- Create partitions and filesystems
- Configure LVM
- Mount filesystems persistently
- Set up swap space

**Strategy**:
- Be very careful with disk operations
- Always verify before writing changes
- Test mounts with `mount -a`

### Category 3: Security Configuration (20-25% of exam)
**Typical Tasks**:
- Configure firewall rules
- Set up SELinux contexts
- Configure file permissions
- Set up sudo access

**Strategy**:
- Security tasks often have dependencies
- Test access from different accounts
- Verify with appropriate tools
- Common commands: `firewall-cmd`, `restorecon`, `chmod`, `visudo`

### Category 4: Service Management (15-20% of exam)
**Typical Tasks**:
- Configure and start services
- Set up scheduled tasks
- Configure logging
- Manage containers

**Strategy**:
- Services must be enabled AND started
- Test functionality after configuration
- Check logs for errors
- Common commands: `systemctl`, `crontab`, `podman`

## 6. Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid

### Critical Mistakes (Task Failure)
1. **Wrong system**: Performing task on wrong host
2. **Permissions errors**: Forgetting to use sudo when needed
3. **Service not enabled**: Starting but not enabling services
4. **Persistent configuration**: Making temporary changes only
5. **Wrong user context**: Performing tasks as wrong user

### Time-Wasting Mistakes
1. **Perfectionism**: Over-configuring beyond requirements
2. **Rabbit holes**: Spending too long troubleshooting one task
3. **Verification obsession**: Testing same thing multiple times
4. **Manual pages deep dive**: Reading entire man pages
5. **Second-guessing**: Changing correct configurations

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Task failure**: Move on, return later if time permits
2. **System broken**: Use rescue mode or reinstall if necessary
3. **Partial credit**: Document what you accomplished
4. **Time pressure**: Focus on verification of completed tasks
5. **Configuration errors**: Revert to working state and retry

## 7. Verification Techniques

### Standard Verification Workflow
```bash
# For each completed task:
1. Test the functionality as requested
2. Verify persistence (reboot if necessary)
3. Check from the perspective described in task
4. Document success in your notes
```

### Service Configuration Verification
```bash
# Always verify services are:
systemctl status service-name      # Running
systemctl is-enabled service-name  # Enabled for boot
# Test actual functionality
```

### Storage Configuration Verification
```bash
# Always verify storage is:
lsblk                    # Properly configured
mount | grep mountpoint  # Currently mounted
cat /etc/fstab          # Persistent configuration
```

### Network Configuration Verification
```bash
# Always verify network is:
ip addr show            # Interface has correct IP
ping target-host        # Connectivity works
ss -tuln               # Services listening on correct ports
```

### User/Security Verification
```bash
# Always verify access is:
su - username          # User can log in
sudo -l -U username    # User has correct sudo rights
ssh username@host      # Remote access works
```

## 8. Lab Environment Setup for Practice

### Recommended Practice Environment
```bash
# Minimum setup for RHCSA practice:
- 2 RHEL 9 VMs (4GB RAM each, 20GB+ disk)
- Network connectivity between systems
- Additional storage devices for LVM practice
- SSH configured between systems
```

### Using Vagrant for Practice (from this repository)
```bash
# Navigate to vagrant directory
cd /path/to/rhcsa/vagrant

# Source credentials and start VMs
source .rhel-credentials && vagrant up

# This provides:
# - rhel9a: Primary practice system
# - rhel9b: Secondary system with extra storage
# - Automatic Red Hat registration
# - Network connectivity configured
```

### Practice Scenarios
1. **Daily practice**: 30-45 minutes on 2-3 tasks
2. **Weekend labs**: 2-3 hour sessions simulating exam conditions
3. **Mock exams**: Full 3-hour timed practice with all task types
4. **Weak area focus**: Dedicated sessions on challenging topics
